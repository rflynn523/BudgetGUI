# BudgetGUI
This Repository will hold all of the files needed to run the BudgetGUI program which interacts with an excel spreadsheet consisting of a monthly and yearly budget. The GUI displays all of the categories that the excel file is tracking along with what the budget is set at, the current spenfing money, and the average amount the user can spend each day to stay under budget. They can then do the following actions: 

  - New Entry - The user can enter a new purchase by entering the date, item, vendor, amount and category. It will then be added to the                     excel file.
  
  - New Month - When this is pressed the excel file will be reset for the next month. A checklist is then performed and displayed to show                   the user if each task was successful.
  
  - Open Excel - This simply closes the GUI window and opens up excel with the budget workbook.
  
  - Add Category - Lets the user input a new category to be track with the budget. Will insert this into the appropriate spots.
